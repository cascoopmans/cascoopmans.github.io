I am a cognitive (neuro)scientist studying how languages are structured, processed and represented in the human brain. I am particularly interested in the combinatorial properties of language – how complex meanings emerge from the structural combination of smaller linguistic units. In my research I use a variety of experimental methods, varying from state-of-the art neuroimaging analyses to old-school armchair linguistics.

I am a postdoctoral researcher at New York University, working with David Poeppel. My current research is about the relationship between syntax and prosody in the brain. Specifically, I investigate how our brains use prosody – the rhythms of speech – to infer the syntactic structure of spoken utterances.

Before moving to New York, I was a postdoc at the Donders Center for Cognitive Neuroimaging in Nijmegen. I got my PhD from the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, under the supervision of Peter Hagoort, Andrea E. Martin, and Helen de Hoop.
